# Inbound file loading using Glue.

#### You:
Inbound File loading using glue job

#### ChatGPT:
Inbound file loading using Glue job typically involves the following steps:

1. Create a Glue connection: A connection is used to connect Glue to a data source. For inbound file loading, you would create a connection to the source system where the file is located. Glue supports various types of connections, including JDBC, S3, FTP, and more.

2. Create a Glue job: A Glue job is a script that processes and transforms data. You can create a Glue job using the AWS Glue console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. In the Glue job, you would specify the source location of the file and any transformation logic required to prepare the data for further processing.

3. Configure Glue job input: In the Glue job, you would specify the input file format, such as CSV, JSON, or Avro. You would also configure any other required parameters, such as delimiter, encoding, or compression.

4. Define Glue job transformation logic: In the Glue job, you would write the code to transform the data. This could include filtering, aggregation, joining, or any other data processing logic required to prepare the data for downstream analysis.

5. Execute the Glue job: Once the Glue job is configured, you can execute it either on-demand or on a schedule. During execution, Glue will read the file from the source system, apply the transformation logic, and write the output to a target system.

6. Monitor and troubleshoot the Glue job: Glue provides various monitoring and logging capabilities to help you monitor the progress of your Glue job and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Overall, Glue provides a flexible and scalable platform for inbound file loading and data processing. It can handle large volumes of data, support various data sources and file formats, and provide powerful transformation capabilities to prepare the data for downstream analysis.

Create a Glue Job to load any Inbound file

#### ChatGPT:
To create a Glue job to load an inbound file, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Glue connection: In the AWS Glue console, navigate to the "Connections" tab and create a connection to the source system where the file is located. For example, if the file is stored in an S3 bucket, you would create an S3 connection.

2. Create a Glue job: In the AWS Glue console, navigate to the "Jobs" tab and click "Add job". Give the job a name and select the IAM role that Glue should use to access resources.

3. Specify the source file location: In the Glue job editor, go to the "Data source" section and select the connection you created in step 1. Then, specify the file location and any required parameters such as delimiter, encoding, or compression.

4. Specify the target file location: In the Glue job editor, go to the "Data targets" section and select the target system where the data should be written. For example, you can choose an S3 bucket or a relational database.

5. Write the transformation logic: In the Glue job editor, go to the "Script" section and write the transformation logic using Apache Spark. You can use Spark SQL or DataFrame API to perform transformations such as filtering, aggregating, or joining data.

6. Save and run the Glue job: After writing the transformation logic, save the Glue job and run it. Glue will read the file from the source location, apply the transformation logic, and write the output to the target location.

7. Monitor and troubleshoot the Glue job: You can monitor the progress of the Glue job in the AWS Glue console or through CloudWatch logs. If there are any issues, you can use the Glue job logs to troubleshoot and fix them.

Overall, creating a Glue job to load an inbound file involves specifying the source and target systems, writing transformation logic using Spark, and monitoring and troubleshooting the job as needed.

For above with python

#### ChatGPT:
To create a Glue job to load an inbound file using Python, you can use the AWS Glue Python library and follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries: In your Python script, import the required AWS Glue libraries such as boto3 and AWSGlue.

```
import boto3
from awsglue.job import Job
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
```

2. Create a Glue context: Create a GlueContext object to access AWS Glue resources.

```
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
```

3. Get the job parameters: Use the getResolvedOptions() method to get the job parameters passed to the script.

```
args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME', 'source_path', 'target_path', 'delimiter'])
```

4. Create a Glue job: Create a Job object using the AWSGlue library.

```
job = Job(glueContext)
job.init(args['JOB_NAME'], args)
```

5. Read the source file: Read the inbound file using Spark and the source location passed in the job parameters.

```
source_path = args['source_path']
delimiter = args['delimiter']

source = glueContext.read.format('csv').option('delimiter', delimiter).load(source_path)
```

6. Transform the data: Use Spark SQL or DataFrame API to perform any transformations on the data.

```
# Example transformation to filter data
transformed_data = source.filter(col('column_name') == 'value')
```

7. Write the data to the target location: Use the write() method to write the data to the target location passed in the job parameters.

```
target_path = args['target_path']

transformed_data.write.format('csv').option('delimiter', delimiter).mode('overwrite').save(target_path)
```

8. Execute the Glue job: Run the Glue job using the Job.commit() method.

```
job.commit()
```

9. Monitor and troubleshoot the Glue job: Use the AWS Glue console or CloudWatch logs to monitor the progress of the Glue job and troubleshoot any issues.

Overall, creating a Glue job to load an inbound file using Python involves creating a Glue context, reading the source file using Spark, transforming the data, writing the data to the target location, and running the Glue job using the Job.commit() method.

# Python Logging: Debugging Errors.

#### You:
logger.debug String has no attribute Debug

#### ChatGPT:
The error message "String has no attribute Debug" suggests that you are trying to call the `Debug` method or attribute on a string object, but it does not exist.

This error can occur if you are using the wrong syntax to call the `debug` method of a logger object in Python. The correct syntax is `logger.debug("message")`, where `logger` is an instance of the `logging.Logger` class. It is possible that you are using the `debug` method on a string object instead of a logger object.

To fix this error, make sure that you have instantiated a logger object using the `logging.getLogger()` method and that you are calling the `debug` method on that object. Here's an example:

```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Use the logger to print debug messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
```

Make sure that you have the `logging` module imported and that you have created a logger object before calling the `debug` method.

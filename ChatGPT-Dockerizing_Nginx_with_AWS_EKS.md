Write Problem statement for running web app with out docker

#### ChatGPT:
Running a web application without using Docker can be problematic in a number of ways. Firstly, it can be difficult to ensure that the application runs consistently across different environments, since the dependencies required to run the app may differ from machine to machine. This can lead to errors and bugs that are difficult to diagnose and fix.

Secondly, without using Docker, deploying the application to a server can be time-consuming and error-prone. The process often involves manually installing dependencies, configuring the server, and copying files over to the appropriate directories. This can lead to inconsistencies between environments and make it difficult to scale the application.

Lastly, running a web application without using Docker may also pose security risks. Since the application is running directly on the host machine, any vulnerabilities or exploits in the application could potentially compromise the entire system. Docker provides an additional layer of security by isolating the application in a container, which can help prevent these types of attacks.

Running Docker Container on AWS EKS using Batch

#### ChatGPT:
Running a Docker container on AWS EKS using Batch can be challenging without the proper knowledge and experience. Firstly, setting up the EKS cluster and configuring it to work with Batch can be a time-consuming process. This involves configuring security groups, VPCs, IAM roles, and other settings to ensure that the cluster is secure and scalable.

Secondly, deploying the Docker container to the EKS cluster using Batch requires a deep understanding of container orchestration and batch processing. The process involves creating batch jobs and defining compute environments, which can be complex and require a lot of trial and error to get right.

Lastly, monitoring and managing the Docker container on the EKS cluster can also be challenging without the proper tools and knowledge. This involves monitoring the health and performance of the container, scaling the container as needed, and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

Overall, running a Docker container on AWS EKS using Batch requires a solid understanding of containerization, batch processing, and cloud infrastructure, as well as the ability to navigate and configure the AWS console and command line interfaces.

Implementation plan for Running Docker Container on AWS EKS using Batch 

#### ChatGPT:
Here is a high-level implementation plan for running a Docker container on AWS EKS using Batch:

1. Set up an EKS cluster: Use the AWS console or CLI to create an EKS cluster, configure the VPC and security groups, and create an IAM role with appropriate permissions for Batch and EKS.

2. Create a Docker image: Build a Docker image that contains the web application and its dependencies, and push it to a container registry like Amazon ECR.

3. Define a compute environment: Use the AWS Batch console or CLI to define a compute environment that meets the requirements of the web application, including the instance types, AMI, and networking configuration.

4. Define a job definition: Define a job definition that specifies the Docker image, the command to run, and any environment variables or other parameters needed by the web application.

5. Submit a job: Use the AWS Batch console or CLI to submit a job to the compute environment. AWS Batch will spin up the required number of instances, pull the Docker image, and run the job on each instance.

6. Monitor and manage the job: Use the AWS Batch console or CLI to monitor the status and performance of the job, scale up or down the number of instances as needed, and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

Overall, the implementation plan involves setting up an EKS cluster, building and pushing a Docker image, defining a compute environment and job definition, submitting a job, and monitoring and managing the job as needed. The exact steps and tools used may vary depending on the specific requirements of the web application and the preferred workflow of the development team.

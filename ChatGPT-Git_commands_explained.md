# Git commands explained.

#### You:
Every Git Command including all options with examples

#### ChatGPT:
As an AI language model, I can provide you with a comprehensive list of Git commands, their options, and brief explanations of what they do. However, please note that this list may not include every possible Git command or option, as new ones can be added with each new release of Git. Additionally, providing examples for every command and option is beyond the scope of this answer, but I will try to provide some examples where relevant. Here's the list:

**Note:** Square brackets (`[ ]`) denote optional parameters, and angled brackets (`< >`) denote required parameters.

## Global Configuration Commands

These commands are used to configure Git on a global level:

- `git config --global user.name "<your_name>"` : Sets your name to be associated with your Git commits.
- `git config --global user.email "<your_email>"` : Sets your email address to be associated with your Git commits.
- `git config --global core.editor <your_editor>` : Sets the default text editor to be used when Git needs you to type in a message. Replace `<your_editor>` with the command used to launch your preferred text editor.

## Repository Setup Commands

These commands are used to create and set up a new Git repository:

- `git init [directory]` : Creates a new Git repository in the specified `directory`. If `directory` is not specified, the repository is created in the current working directory.
- `git clone [url] [directory]` : Creates a new Git repository by copying an existing one from the specified `url`. If `directory` is not specified, the repository is cloned into a new directory with the same name as the remote repository.

## Basic Snapshotting Commands

These commands are used to manage and track changes to the files in your repository:

- `git add [file]` : Adds the specified `file` to the staging area, ready to be committed.
- `git commit -m "<message>"` : Commits the changes in the staging area with a descriptive `<message>`.
- `git status` : Shows the current status of your repository, including which files have been modified and which ones are staged for committing.
- `git diff [file]` : Shows the differences between the working directory and the last committed version of the specified `file`.

## Branching and Merging Commands

These commands are used to manage multiple lines of development in your repository:

- `git branch` : Lists all the branches in your repository, with an asterisk next to the currently active branch.
- `git branch [branch_name]` : Creates a new branch with the specified `branch_name`.
- `git checkout [branch_name]` : Switches to the specified `branch_name`.
- `git merge [branch_name]` : Merges the specified `branch_name` into the current branch.
- `git log` : Shows a log of all commits in your repository.

## Sharing and Updating Projects Commands

These commands are used to interact with remote repositories and keep your local repository up to date with changes made to the remote repository:

- `git remote add [remote_name] [remote_url]` : Adds a new remote repository with the specified `remote_name` and `remote_url`.
- `git fetch [remote_name]` : Fetches changes made to the remote repository, but does not merge them with your local repository.
- `git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]` : Fetches changes made to the remote repository and merges them with your local repository.
- `git push [remote_name] [branch_name]` : Pushes the changes in your local repository to the remote repository.

These are some of the most commonly used Git commands and options, but there are many more available. You

can get more information about specific commands and options by using the `git help` command followed by the name of the command or option you want to learn more about. For example, `git help commit` will give you more information about the `commit` command.

Here are some additional Git commands and options you may find useful:

## Stashing Commands

These commands are used to temporarily store changes that are not yet ready to be committed:

- `git stash` : Stashes changes in the working directory that are not yet staged or committed.
- `git stash apply` : Applies the most recently created stash to the working directory.
- `git stash list` : Lists all stashes that have been created.

## Tagging Commands

These commands are used to create and manage tags, which are named references to specific commits:

- `git tag` : Lists all tags in the repository.
- `git tag [tag_name]` : Creates a new tag with the specified `tag_name` at the current commit.
- `git push [remote_name] [tag_name]` : Pushes the specified `tag_name` to the remote repository.
- `git tag -d [tag_name]` : Deletes the specified `tag_name`.

## Advanced Git Commands

These commands are more advanced and may not be used as frequently as the ones listed above:

- `git rebase [branch_name]` : Reapplies commits from the specified `branch_name` on top of the current branch.
- `git cherry-pick [commit_id]` : Applies the changes from the specified `commit_id` to the current branch.
- `git reset [commit_id]` : Resets the current branch to the specified `commit_id`.
- `git revert [commit_id]` : Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified `commit_id`.

These are just a few examples of the many Git commands and options available. It's important to note that Git is a very powerful and flexible tool, and different workflows may require different commands and options. It's always a good idea to read the documentation and experiment with different commands to find the ones that work best for your specific use case.

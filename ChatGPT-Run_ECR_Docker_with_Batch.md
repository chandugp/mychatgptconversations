To run a Docker image from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using AWS Batch, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create an IAM role that allows AWS Batch to access ECR. The role should have permissions to list and pull images from your ECR repository.

2. Create a job definition for your Docker image. You can specify the Docker image URI from your ECR repository as the container image in the job definition.

3. Create a job queue and compute environment for your Batch job.

4. Submit a job to the job queue, specifying the job definition, input data, and any other necessary parameters.

Here is an example AWS Batch job definition that uses a Docker image from ECR:

```json
{
  "jobDefinitionName": "my-ecr-job-definition",
  "type": "container",
  "containerProperties": {
    "image": "<your-ecr-repository-url>/<your-docker-image>:<image-tag>",
    "vcpus": 1,
    "memory": 1024,
    "command": ["<your-command>", "<command-argument>"]
  },
  "retryStrategy": {
    "attempts": 1
  }
}
```

You can then submit this job definition to your Batch job queue using the `aws batch submit-job` command. Be sure to specify any necessary input data or parameters in your job submission.

For more information on using AWS Batch with ECR, please see the official AWS Batch documentation.
